This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```terminal
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server with:

```terminal
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

-   Would spend more time finding correct image size, depending on the screen size.
-   Would spend more time on loading states between route changes
-   Would put api URL and Access token in environment variables
-   Could implement infinite scroll with Intersection Observer API
-   Write e2e tests with cypress
-   Would spend more time with error handling, eg. 404 / 500 / unknown, and error screens for these
-   Would spend more time on finding correct types for each API response (from unsplash?)
-   Could implement search functionality by having another query param "?query="
-   Would spend more time on accessibility through aria-labels etc.
-   Would probably implement a page for a more detailed view of a certain image / download / share etc?
